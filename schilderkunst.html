<p>The coat-of-arms at the lower right part of the painting refer to the family
of the king (that with the Polish crowned eagle) and the most important
countries of the king (Hungary, Dalmatia, Bohemia).</p>
<p>The painting represents an interesting transition between an idealized
portrait and a religious picture.</p>

1512<br>
Oil and tempera on panel, 215 x 115 cm (each, including frame)<br>
Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg<br>
</font></p>
<p>D&uuml;rer's only commission for panel paintings from Nuremberg's city council
was for a pair <font color="#ff0000">of</font> portraits <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Emperors Charlemagne and Sigismund. These were ordered for the Treasure
Chamber in the Schopper House, where the imperial regalia were kept the night
before they went on ceremonial display on the Friday after Easter. For the rest <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the year the regalia were housed in the Church <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Hospital <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the Holy Ghost. D&uuml;rer was probably
commissioned for the portraits in 1510 and received his final payment three
years later. His panels are believed to have been ordered to replace two earlier
works, now lost, which had been painted soon after the regalia were brought to
Nuremberg in 1424.</p>
<p>The half length pictures are larger than life. No likenesses are known <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
Charlemagne, who ruled from 800-14, and D&uuml;rer therefore invented his portrait,
presenting him frontally in an imposing posture. His interpretation <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
Charlemagne's appearance was to influence depictions <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Emperor until well into the nineteenth century. For Sigismund, who ruled
from 1410-37, D&uuml;rer must have had access to a portrait done during his reign.</p>
<p>The two paintings include the appropriate <font color="#ff0000">coat</font>s <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
<font color="#ff0000">arms</font>, the German eagle and French fleur-de-lis for
Charlemagne and the <font color="#ff0000">arms</font> <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the five territories ruled by Sigismund, the German Empire, Bohemia, Old and New
Hungary and Luxembourg. Inscriptions name the two men and state the number <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
years they ruled, 14 years for Charlemagne and 28 for Sigismund. Around the four
sides <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the panels are explanatory texts on the
frames. The first records: `Charlemagne reigned for 14 years. He was the son <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Frankish King Pippin, and Roman Emperor. He made the Roman Empire subject to
German rule. His crown and garments are put on public display annually in
Nuremberg, together with other relics.' On the second panel is the text:
`Emperor Sigismund ruled for 28 years. He was always well-disposed to the city <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
N&uuml;remberg, bestowing upon it many special signs <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
his favour. In the year 1424, he brought here from Prague the relics that are
shown every year.'</p>
<p>Although the two panels were originally designed as a diptych, they were
ultimately displayed separately. Other texts on the reverse <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the panels suggest that the painted side was normally hung facing the wall, with
the portraits only being shown on special occasions, presumably for the annual
display <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the regalia. The two panels were hung on
either side <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the shrine in which the relics were
housed.</p>
<p>D&uuml;rer prepared studies <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the individual pieces
<font color="#ff0000">of</font> the regalia and reproduced them with great
accuracy. Charlemagne wears the imperial crown and brandishes his sword and orb.
Sigismund has a Gothic crown and holds a sceptre and orb. The annual display <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the imperial regalia ended in 1525 and D&uuml;rer's panels were then moved to the
city hall. Since 1880 they have been on loan to the Germanisches Museum in
Nuremberg. As for the regalia, the Habsburgs later took them to Vienna where
they remained in the imperial treasury, except for a brief period when they were
seized by the Nazis and returned to N&uuml;remberg.</p>

<p>Emperor Maximilian I&nbsp; , 1519<br>
Oil on lindenwood, 74 x 62 cm<br>
Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna</p>
<p>Maximilian I <font color="#ff0000">of</font> Austria (1459-1519) became head <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Habsburgs in 1493 and was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1508. He was a
learned ruler with a strong interest in the arts. D&uuml;rer first met him during a
visit to N&uuml;remberg in 1512 and was commissioned to work on the gigantic woodcuts
of The Triumphal Arch and The Triumphal Procession,
as well as decorations for Maximilian's prayer book. In 1515 he was awarded an
annual payment of 100 florins by the Emperor.</p>
<p>On 28 June 1518 D&uuml;rer had sketched Maximilian during the Imperial Diet at
Augsburg. He inscribed the drawing: `This is Emperor Maximilian, whom I,
Albrecht D&uuml;rer, portrayed up in his small chamber in the tower at Augsburg on
the Monday after the feast day of John the Baptist
in the year 1518. In the relatively informal sketch D&uuml;rer captured a hint <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the fatigued resignation <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the 59 year-old ruler.</p>
<p>Maxmilian I died on 12 January 1519 and D&uuml;rer then used his drawing as the
basis for a woodcut and two painted portraits, one in tempera (Germanisches
Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) and this one in oil. These finished works are formal
portraits and lack some <font color="#ff0000">of</font> the human character
which comes out in the original sketch. In the oil portrait, the Emperor is
dressed in an elegant fur, which D&uuml;rer has painted with great care. Instead <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
an orb, the Emperor holds a broken pomegranate, a symbol <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the Resurrection and Maximilian's personal emblem. At the top <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
the picture is the Habsburg <font color="#ff0000">coat</font> <font color="#ff0000">of</font>
<font color="#ff0000">arms</font> with the double-headed eagle and a lengthy
inscription on Maximilian's achievements. The Emperor looks alo<font color="#ff0000">of</font>
and withdrawn, an expression <font color="#ff0000">of</font> his dignity.</p>
